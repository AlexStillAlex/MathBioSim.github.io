JS simulations
==============

Two javascript simulation examples.

Particles
=========

Open ``particles/index.html`` in a browser (better in Google Chrome or Opera).
This is a simple mass-spring physics simulation.

Grayscott
=========

Open ``grayscott/index.html`` in a browser (better in Google Chrome or Opera).
This is a solver for the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. Roughly, this
can be seen as a simulation of the behavior of diffusive living beings reproducing
under conditions of limited food. Very different patterns emerge for
slight changes in feeding and death rates.
